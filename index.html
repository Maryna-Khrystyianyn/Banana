    <h1>All about bananas</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        Bananas are one of the most consumed and cheapest fruits worldwide: they
        are the most traded fruit and the fifth most traded agricultural
        product. The global export value of the banana trade was estimated to be
        US $8 billion in 2016, with a retail value between $20 and 25 billion.

      <h2>How Bananas Are Grown</h2>
      <p>
        People often assume that the banana fruit grows on trees, however, the
        banana is a high herb which can grow up to 15 metres. There are over
        1000 different varieties of bananas growing around the world, subdivided
        into 50 groups. Some are sweet, like the Cavendish variety, which is the
        most common and most widely exported. It is named after Musa Cavendishii
        and was first grown at Chatsworth House in the UK in 1830. This variety
        of banana is currently under threat from a disease called Sigatoka,
        which has reduced banana yields by 40% every year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Banana plants are often mistaken for trees or palms – they are actually
        herbs. The banana is a perennial plant that replaces itself. Bananas do
        not grow from a seed but from a bulb or rhizome, and it takes 9 to 12
        months from sowing a banana bulb to harvesting the fruit. The banana
        flower appears in the sixth or seventh month. Unlike other fruit like
        apples which have a growing season, bananas are available all year
        round. Banana plants thrive in tropical regions where the average
        temperature is 80° F (27° C) and the yearly rainfall is between 78 and
        98 inches. Most bananas exported are grown within 30 degrees either side
        of the equator. The plants need rich, dark and fertile soils with steady
        moisture in the air and ground and good drainage.
      </p>
      <h2>Harvesting & Ripening</h2>
      <p>
        After nine months, the bananas are harvested while still green. At the
        packhouse they are inspected and sorted for export. Buyers of fruit in
        the UK want unbruised bananas and so very high standards are set. If the
        bananas do not meet these standards they are usually sold locally at a
        much lower price. The fruit is then transported to ports to be packed in
        refrigerated ships called reefers (bananas take between six and twelve
        days to get to the UK/Europe). In order to increase shelf life, they are
        transported at a temperature of 13.3°C, and require careful handling in
        order to prevent damage. Humidity, ventilation and temperature
        conditions are also carefully monitored in order to maintain quality.
        When the bananas arrive at their destination port they are first sent to
        ripening rooms (a process involving ethylene gas) and then sent to the
        shops.

          <p>
            Vitamin B6 from bananas is easily absorbed by your body and a
            medium-sized banana can provide about a quarter of your daily
            vitamin B6 needs.
          </p>
          <h4 style="text-align: left">Vitamin B6 helps your body:</h4>

            <li>produce red blood cells,</li>
            <li>
              metabolise carbohydrates and fats, turning them into energy,
            </li>
            <li>metabolise amino acids,</li>
            <li>maintain a healthy nervous system.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Bananas are respectable sources of vitamin C</h3>
          <p>
            You may not associate bananas with vitamin C but a medium-sized
            banana will provide about 10% of your daily vitamin C needs.
          </p>
          <h4>Vitamin C helps:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>protect your body against cell and tissue damage,</li>
            <li>your body absorb iron better,</li>

              bones and body together, and
            </li>
            <li>
              support brain health by producing serotonin, a hormone that
              affects our sleep cycle, moods, and experiences of stress a​nd
              pain.

          <h3>Manganese in bananas is good for your skin</h3>
          <p>
            One medium-sized banana provides approximately 13% of your daily
            manganese needs. Manganese helps your body make collagen and
            protects your skin and other cells against free radical damage.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>
            Potassium in bananas is good for your heart health and blood
            pressure
          </h3>
          <p>
            A medium-sized banana will provide around 320-400 mg of potassium,
            which meets about 10% of your daily potassium needs. Potassium helps
            your body maintain a healthy heart and blood pressure. In addition,
            bananas are low in sodium. The low sodium and high potassium
            combination helps to control high blood pressure.
